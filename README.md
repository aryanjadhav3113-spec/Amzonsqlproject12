This SQL program creates a **bank_db database** with a **transactions table** that records customer IDs, transaction amounts, and dates. It inserts sample transaction data and then uses **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** to find customers who made **more than one transaction above ₹6000**, showing their total count of high-value transactions.
